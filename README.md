## Architecture

The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with ReactJS. It fetches product and user data from the backend REST API. State management is done via Redux Toolkit to manage cart and user session globally. Tailwind CSS is used for styling and Ant Design provides reusable UI components.
